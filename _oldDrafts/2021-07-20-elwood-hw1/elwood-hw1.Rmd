# Some quick code reminders
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

# Here's an example of storing an object.
hello <- paste("Hello World!")

# Look over there ->
# In the "Environment" window, you'll see that you've created an object that is
# now stored in your workspace.

# Now type hello. R "pastes" the line of text that says "Hello World!" as your output.

# Ok, with those reminders out of the way, let's get some data into R

# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-
# Reading in Data
# =-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

# What you need to do from here on out is dependent on the dataset
# you choose to work with! Here's an example of how I'd approach this with
# a file using "+" as a delimiter

myData <- read_tsv("../../_data/covid-responses.tab")

# let's unpack that a bit.
# I'm creating an object called myData
# I'm using the read.delim() function to read it in
# I'm specifying the name of the file; it's in my working directory!
# I'm specifying the delimiter (here, "+", but often commas (",") or tabs ("\t")
# I'm specifying that there is a header included in the data that features the variable names
# Don't forget to look at the data import samples code to get examples of other ways to import data.

# Now, let's check the first few rows. I'll let you remember how to do that!
head(myData)
# How many rows of data are there in this dataset?
dim(myData)
print("There are 3460 rows")
# How many columns are there in the dataset?
print("There are 80 columns")
# What are the column names?
colnames(myData)
# Should any of these columns have gather() or spread() applied to them to make them more
# useful? If so, perform those operations. If you want a challenge, try to use
# pivot_longer() or pivot_wider() instead.
print("The gather function is useful when variables are spread across columns. In this dataset
      it seems that each column represents a unique variable, and so gathering is unnecessary.
      Similarly, the spread function is useful when observations are split across multiple rows
      and you want to organize them under a single column. In this dataset each row represents
      a unique observation, so spreading is unnecessary.")

# I printed every column for the first 10 rows to get a better grasp of the whole dataset:
options(tibble.width = Inf)
# print(myData)

# Do one operation that requires creating a new object and doing something to that object

# There is a block of the survey called "Perception of policies, anxiety" from columns
# "percievedreaction" to "Q26". If we wanted to focus in on this block for whatever reason, 
# we could use select() to make a new dataset with only those columns.

perPolAnx <- select(myData, perceivedreaction:Q26)
print(perPolAnx)

# Do one thing to some portion of these data that hasn't been covered so far in the course materials. Be creative and have fun!

# The survey asks respondents to react on a scale of 1 to 5. In this dataset those responses
# are stored as strings ranging from Strongly Distrust to Strongly Trust. If we want to perform
# numeric operations on these responses (such as finding the mean) we have to convert them back
# to numeric form using mutate() and recode(). Here this is done for Q36:

perPolAnx <- mutate(perPolAnx, Q36N = recode(Q36, "Strongly distrust" = 1, "Distrust" = 2, "Neither trust nor
                                 distrust" = 3, "Somewhat trust" = 4, "Strongly trust" = 5))
#print(perPolAnx)

# Now we can find the mean:
summarize(perPolAnx, Q36mean = mean(Q36N, na.rm = TRUE))

```
