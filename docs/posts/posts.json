Unified School District (LAUSD) in CA. LAUSD is the largest school district in CA and the 2nd largest school district in the U.S. in terms of number of students. “The SENI was implemented to create a more inclusive and holistic understanding of our students’ needs, and to empower schools with additional funds to address those needs at the local level” (Advancement Project, California, 2021) I would like to compare some school demographics. LAUSD consists of 6 local districts, South, East, Central, West, NW, and NE. The dataset shows counts of foster youth, homeless youth, and English learners in each elementary schools. I would like to compare those groups within local districts and find which local district has the highest rates.In the SENI dataset I would like to take a look at 4 variables, the Homeless, Foster, and English Learning Counts. The counts are reported by each elementary school in LAUSD. I would like to compare those numbers by local districts that are within LAUSD.\r\n\r\n\r\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)\r\nlibrary(tidyverse)\r\nlibrary(distill)\r\nlibrary(blogbuilder)\r\nlibrary(knitr)\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Description of the relationship between the variables, including a hypothesis (or hypotheses) about the relationship.\r\nWith the pivot table above I can see that the South local district has the most homeless and foster students and Central local district has the most English Learning students. Based on total students enrolled in each local district, the Central local district has the highest rates of homeless and English learning students and the South local district has the highest rate of foster children. We can take a look at the relationship between these rates and their location. According to the Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce, neighborhoods of concentrated poverty are clustered throughout South Los Angeles and Downtown adjacent areas, which is where the South and Central local districts are located. A hypothesis here can be that the highest level of homeless students are most likely to attend schools in the South Local District, making a correlation between location and homeless students and maybe English learning students.**\r\n5. Initial demonstration of the relationship, which could include correlation, visualization, or statistical model. Appropriate visualizations.\r\nA bar/column chart clearly shows which of the local districts have the highest rates of each group of interest. Highlighting the value or observation you want to draw focus on helps get the message across. This could help if maybe I am trying to get a key stakeholder to allocate funding or provide certain resources to a local district in need.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I want to try and arrange totals by descending order to see largest to least. I think a bar chart for each Count can be a good way to go to show numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n#Creating a bar graph to show homeless count in each local district. \r\n#Note to self: Remember to use back ticks `` on variable names for it to work!\r\nlibrary(ggplot2)\r\ngg_homeless <- ggplot(data=seni_homeless, aes(x=`Local District`, y=`Total_Homeless`)) +\r\n         geom_bar(stat=\"identity\")\r\ngg_homeless\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther visuals to consider using is a different column graph showing all the variables of interest and setting them as different colors and leaving local districts on the y axis. But I still think separating them to small multiples would be better. Stacked bars can get confusing. It would be cool if I can create the map of the local districts and show density of populations with colors, for example, the south local district will have the darkest shade and the east will have the lightest shade. That sounds like it could be a lot to figure out to do in R but I can look into it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

LAUSD is the largest school district in CA and the 2nd largest school district in the U.S. in terms of number of students. “The SENI was implemented to create a more inclusive and holistic understanding of our students’ needs, and to empower schools with additional funds to address those needs at the local level.” I’m going to try and compare some school demographics.
