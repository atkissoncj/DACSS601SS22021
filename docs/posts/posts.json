I happened to be slacking off from practicing R, when in the middle of an article (posted on theintercept.com, if I’m not mistaken) the above mentioned project was referenced. The dataset I chose to use is entitled Disorder Involving the Media. It contains “data on political violence and demonstrations involving journalists and media workers.”\n#First I am going to load the data, which you will not see since I used the “include=FALSE” option in my first chunk of code.\n#Next, I am going to preview the first few rows of the data using the “head()” function.\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 29\n    ISO EVENT_ID_CNTY EVENT_ID_NO_CNTY EVENT_DATE           YEAR\n  <dbl> <chr>                    <dbl> <dttm>              <dbl>\n1     0 XKX35                       35 2018-04-20 00:00:00  2018\n2     0 XKX38                       38 2018-05-03 00:00:00  2018\n3     0 XKX52                       52 2018-06-12 00:00:00  2018\n4     0 XKX86                       86 2018-09-09 00:00:00  2018\n5     0 XKX167                     167 2019-01-28 00:00:00  2019\n6     0 XKX260                     260 2019-08-23 00:00:00  2019\n  TIME_PRECISION EVENT_TYPE                 SUB_EVENT_TYPE  \n           <dbl> <chr>                      <chr>           \n1              2 Violence against civilians Attack          \n2              1 Protests                   Peaceful protest\n3              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \n4              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \n5              1 Protests                   Peaceful protest\n6              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \n  ACTOR1                            ASSOC_ACTOR_1                  \n  <chr>                             <chr>                          \n1 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) Albanian Ethnic Group (Kosovo) \n2 Protesters (Kosovo)               Journalists (Kosovo)           \n3 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) <NA>                           \n4 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) Albanian Ethnic Group (Kosovo) \n5 Protesters (Kosovo)               Journalists (Kosovo)           \n6 Private Security Forces (Kosovo)  PDK: Democratic Party of Kosovo\n  INTER1 ACTOR2            \n   <dbl> <chr>             \n1      3 Civilians (Kosovo)\n2      6 <NA>              \n3      3 Civilians (Kosovo)\n4      3 Civilians (Serbia)\n5      6 <NA>              \n6      8 Civilians (Kosovo)\n  ASSOC_ACTOR_2                                       INTER2\n  <chr>                                                <dbl>\n1 Journalists (Kosovo); Women (Kosovo)                     7\n2 <NA>                                                     0\n3 Journalists (Kosovo)                                     7\n4 Journalists (Serbia); Serbian Ethnic Group (Kosovo)      7\n5 <NA>                                                     0\n6 Journalists (Kosovo)                                     7\n  INTERACTION REGION COUNTRY ADMIN1    ADMIN2          ADMIN3\n        <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>     <chr>           <chr> \n1          37 Europe Kosovo  Mitrovica North Mitrovica <NA>  \n2          60 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \n3          37 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \n4          37 Europe Kosovo  Mitrovica Skenderaj       <NA>  \n5          60 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \n6          78 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \n  LOCATION        LATITUDE LONGITUDE GEO_PRECISION SOURCE            \n  <chr>              <dbl>     <dbl>         <dbl> <chr>             \n1 North Mitrovica     42.9      20.9             1 Vecernje Novosti  \n2 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 Zeri; Local Source\n3 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 UNMIK             \n4 Prekaz              42.8      20.8             1 B92.net           \n5 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 BBC News; RTK     \n6 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 Insajderi         \n  SOURCE_SCALE        \n  <chr>               \n1 Regional            \n2 Subnational-Regional\n3 National            \n4 Regional            \n5 National-Regional   \n6 National            \n  NOTES                                                               \n  <chr>                                                               \n1 As reported on April 20, 2018, female journalists on Serbian Pink T~\n2 On May 3, 2018, on the occasion of the World Press Freedom Day, in ~\n3 On June 12, 2018 in Pristina, Kosovo, Valon Rashiti, a reporter for~\n4 On September 9, 2018 in Prekaz, Kosovo, two female reporters of Deu~\n5 On January 28, 2019 in Pristina, Kosovo, employees of public broadc~\n6 On August 23, a journalist was attacked and punched by PDK leader's~\n  FATALITIES  TIMESTAMP\n       <dbl>      <dbl>\n1          0 1572403786\n2          0 1574110420\n3          0 1553853272\n4          0 1572403700\n5          0 1572403627\n6          0 1567533545\n\nHmm, can’t seem to glean much from that… we’ll come back to select specific variables in a bit. For now, let’s see how many rows and columns are in this dataset. I can do this with the “ncol()” and “nrow()” functions. Doing this, I see that there are 29 columns and 12460 rows in the journalist.data dataset. What you don’t see in the last sentence is that my row and column amounts were calculated within backstrokes (these little guys ``, not to be confused with these guys’ ’. See chapter 27.2 in the R for Data Science textbook for this trick).\n#Let me give you the column names from my dataset.\n\n [1] \"ISO\"              \"EVENT_ID_CNTY\"    \"EVENT_ID_NO_CNTY\"\n [4] \"EVENT_DATE\"       \"YEAR\"             \"TIME_PRECISION\"  \n [7] \"EVENT_TYPE\"       \"SUB_EVENT_TYPE\"   \"ACTOR1\"          \n[10] \"ASSOC_ACTOR_1\"    \"INTER1\"           \"ACTOR2\"          \n[13] \"ASSOC_ACTOR_2\"    \"INTER2\"           \"INTERACTION\"     \n[16] \"REGION\"           \"COUNTRY\"          \"ADMIN1\"          \n[19] \"ADMIN2\"           \"ADMIN3\"           \"LOCATION\"        \n[22] \"LATITUDE\"         \"LONGITUDE\"        \"GEO_PRECISION\"   \n[25] \"SOURCE\"           \"SOURCE_SCALE\"     \"NOTES\"           \n[28] \"FATALITIES\"       \"TIMESTAMP\"       \n\n#As far as my untrained eye can see, there is no need for the gather() or spread() function in the dataset. Each variable has its own column, each observation its own row, and each value has its own cell. Great job ACLED, very professional!\n#Take a look at the following columns of data:\n\n# A tibble: 12,460 x 2\n   EVENT_DATE          TIME_PRECISION\n   <dttm>                       <dbl>\n 1 2018-04-20 00:00:00              2\n 2 2018-05-03 00:00:00              1\n 3 2018-06-12 00:00:00              1\n 4 2018-09-09 00:00:00              1\n 5 2019-01-28 00:00:00              1\n 6 2019-08-23 00:00:00              1\n 7 2019-12-17 00:00:00              1\n 8 2020-03-23 00:00:00              1\n 9 2020-04-11 00:00:00              1\n10 2020-12-22 00:00:00              1\n# ... with 12,450 more rows\n\nLooking through the codebook for the data I can see that the TIME_PRECISION column refers to the precision of the time an event occurred in the previous column EVENT_DATE. A code of “1” indicates the event happened on a specific day, a code of “2” indicates the even happened sometime during a specified week, and a code of “3” sometime during a specified month. I am going to recode these numbers to correspond to text. I’ll include the code as a reference to what I did.\n\n\njournalist.data <- mutate(journalist.data, certaintyOfDate= recode(TIME_PRECISION, `1`= \"dayOf\", `2`= \"weekOf\", `3`= \"monthOf\")) \nhead(select(journalist.data, certaintyOfDate, EVENT_DATE))\n\n\n# A tibble: 6 x 2\n  certaintyOfDate EVENT_DATE         \n  <chr>           <dttm>             \n1 weekOf          2018-04-20 00:00:00\n2 dayOf           2018-05-03 00:00:00\n3 dayOf           2018-06-12 00:00:00\n4 dayOf           2018-09-09 00:00:00\n5 dayOf           2019-01-28 00:00:00\n6 dayOf           2019-08-23 00:00:00\n\nAnd there you have it! You can now see I’ve recoded the TIME_PRECISION column to certaintyOfDate. I’ve also included the EVENT_DATE column so you can see what the TIME_PRECISION column is referring to.\n###Now for the be creative and have fun part. I’ll include the code so y’alls can see. I spent some time in the forums trying to get the barchart on the up and up.
