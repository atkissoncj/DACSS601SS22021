For this example, I attempted to search for a correlation between “perceived reaction” to the Corona virus outbreak and whether or not participants engaged in handshakes, participated in social endeavors, traveled to stores, and abode by curfew hours. Overall, I was unable to deduce anything worthwhile. However, I was able to practice my tidying skills. Until next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Variables include the number of sales, resale value, price, fuel efficiency, and more. I wish to assess why certain models sell and resell for the most. I wish to also find a correlation between sale price and resale price.\r\nUnit Sales vs. Year Resale Value (which car sold the most?)\r\n\r\n\r\nmyDataPath %>%\r\n  select(Manufacturer, Model, Sales_in_thousands, X__year_resale_value) %>% \r\n  arrange(desc(Sales_in_thousands, X__year_resale_value)) %>%\r\n  slice(1:10)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Manufacturer      Model Sales_in_thousands X__year_resale_value\r\n1          Ford   F-Series            540.561               15.075\r\n2          Ford   Explorer            276.747               16.640\r\n3        Toyota      Camry            247.994               13.245\r\n4          Ford     Taurus            245.815               10.055\r\n5         Honda     Accord            230.902               13.210\r\n6         Dodge Ram Pickup            227.061               15.060\r\n7          Ford     Ranger            220.650                7.850\r\n8         Honda      Civic            199.685                9.850\r\n9         Dodge    Caravan            181.749               12.025\r\n10         Ford      Focus            175.670                   NA\r\n\r\nAt this point, we can tell the Ford F-Series is the highest selling vehicle by a considerable margin. I want to find out why that is. It is important to note that the Ford F-Series refers to the F-150, F-250, F-350, and F-450 models. In other words, the single Ford F-Series Variable is an umbrella term for 4 different models. Overall, the Ford F-150, F-250, and F-350 are vehicles that have stark physical differences all around. Contrastingly, the Ford F-450 and F-350 are relatively similar as both models utilize dual rear-wheel functionality for increased towing capability. Indeed, the original creator of the data did not create separate cell entries for cars like the Mercedes S-Class (which includes the S350, S450, S550, S63 AMG, and S65 AMG models). However, the creator did enter individual cells for the Porsche Carrera Cabrio and the Porsche Carrera Coupe. Both the Porsche Carrera Cabrio and Carrera Coupe belong to the flagship 911 line offered by Porsche. Therefore, it makes more sense to combine all of the Porsche Carrera Data.\r\nYear Resale Value vs. Unit Sales (which car resales for the most?)\r\n\r\n\r\nmyDataPath %>%\r\n  select(Manufacturer, Model, Sales_in_thousands, X__year_resale_value) %>% \r\n  arrange(desc(X__year_resale_value)) %>%\r\n  slice(1:10)\r\n\r\n\r\n   Manufacturer          Model Sales_in_thousands\r\n1       Porsche Carrera Cabrio              1.866\r\n2       Porsche  Carrera Coupe              1.280\r\n3    Mercedes-B       SL-Class              3.311\r\n4         Dodge          Viper              0.916\r\n5    Mercedes-B        S-Class             16.774\r\n6    Mercedes-B        E-Class             27.602\r\n7       Porsche         Boxter              8.982\r\n8         Lexus          LS400              6.375\r\n9          Audi             A8              1.380\r\n10    Chevrolet       Corvette             17.947\r\n   X__year_resale_value\r\n1                67.550\r\n2                60.625\r\n3                58.600\r\n4                58.470\r\n5                50.375\r\n6                41.450\r\n7                41.250\r\n8                40.375\r\n9                39.000\r\n10               36.225\r\n\r\nThe Porsche Carrera Cabrio has the highest resale price of any car on this list. Not surprisingly, the Porsche Carrera Cabrio has a considerably low amount of sales. The low sales likely have much to do with the impracticality of a coupe convertible and the significant cost of the car.\r\n\r\n\r\nmyDataPath %>%\r\n  select(Manufacturer, Model, Sales_in_thousands, X__year_resale_value) %>%\r\n  summarize(range(Sales_in_thousands), range(X__year_resale_value, na.rm = TRUE))\r\n\r\n\r\n  range(Sales_in_thousands) range(X__year_resale_value, na.rm = TRUE)\r\n1                     0.110                                      5.16\r\n2                   540.561                                     67.55\r\n\r\nThe range of the “sales_in_thousands” is 540.441 and the range of \"X__year_resale_value\" is 62.39. Therefore, we can deduce that a great deal of contrast and variability exists with regards to cars sold and resale value. Additionally, a sharper contrast exists between the range of units sold and the resale value. With regards to missing data, there are resale values missing for many different observations. Also, a large majority of the data for the Chrysler Town & Country is missing in addition to several values for the Acura CL. I will have to calculate which year this data set was compiled during and what “power_perf_factor” means. At the very least, I am fairly sure this data was compiled between 2011 & 2012 as the “Latest_Launch variable” seems to indicate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

If so, perform those operations. If you want a challenge, try to use pivot_longer() or pivot_wider() instead.\r\nGiven that each “id” and “source” are quite distinct, I don’t think gather() and spread() or pivot_longer() or pivot_wider() could have been useful in this data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# creating a new object and make it to function \r\nselectedHearingsData <- hearingsData %>%\r\n  dplyr::rename(\"cisyear\" = \"CISYear\", \"filterHouse\" = \"filter_House\", \r\n                \"filterSenate\" = \"filter_Senate\", \"filterJoint\" = \"filter_Joint\",\r\n                \"cisCommittee\" = \"CISCommittee\") %>%\r\n  dplyr::select(id, source, cisyear, filterHouse, filterSenate, filterJoint,\r\n                cisCommittee)\r\n\r\n# Arrange the selectedHearingsData\r\narrangedHearingsData <- selectedHearingsData %>%\r\n  arrange(desc(id))\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find this function very useful when trying to inspect data. It provides as outputs both the number of rows and columns, the names of the columns (variables) in a dataset, and the structure of the each variable.

It contains “data on political violence and demonstrations involving journalists and media workers.”\r\n#First I am going to load the data, which you will not see since I used the “include=FALSE” option in my first chunk of code.\r\n#Next, I am going to preview the first few rows of the data using the “head()” function.\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 29\r\n    ISO EVENT_ID_CNTY EVENT_ID_NO_CNTY EVENT_DATE           YEAR\r\n  <dbl> <chr>                    <dbl> <dttm>              <dbl>\r\n1     0 XKX35                       35 2018-04-20 00:00:00  2018\r\n2     0 XKX38                       38 2018-05-03 00:00:00  2018\r\n3     0 XKX52                       52 2018-06-12 00:00:00  2018\r\n4     0 XKX86                       86 2018-09-09 00:00:00  2018\r\n5     0 XKX167                     167 2019-01-28 00:00:00  2019\r\n6     0 XKX260                     260 2019-08-23 00:00:00  2019\r\n  TIME_PRECISION EVENT_TYPE                 SUB_EVENT_TYPE  \r\n           <dbl> <chr>                      <chr>           \r\n1              2 Violence against civilians Attack          \r\n2              1 Protests                   Peaceful protest\r\n3              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \r\n4              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \r\n5              1 Protests                   Peaceful protest\r\n6              1 Violence against civilians Attack          \r\n  ACTOR1                            ASSOC_ACTOR_1                  \r\n  <chr>                             <chr>                          \r\n1 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) Albanian Ethnic Group (Kosovo) \r\n2 Protesters (Kosovo)               Journalists (Kosovo)           \r\n3 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) <NA>                           \r\n4 Unidentified Armed Group (Kosovo) Albanian Ethnic Group (Kosovo) \r\n5 Protesters (Kosovo)               Journalists (Kosovo)           \r\n6 Private Security Forces (Kosovo)  PDK: Democratic Party of Kosovo\r\n  INTER1 ACTOR2            \r\n   <dbl> <chr>             \r\n1      3 Civilians (Kosovo)\r\n2      6 <NA>              \r\n3      3 Civilians (Kosovo)\r\n4      3 Civilians (Serbia)\r\n5      6 <NA>              \r\n6      8 Civilians (Kosovo)\r\n  ASSOC_ACTOR_2                                       INTER2\r\n  <chr>                                                <dbl>\r\n1 Journalists (Kosovo); Women (Kosovo)                     7\r\n2 <NA>                                                     0\r\n3 Journalists (Kosovo)                                     7\r\n4 Journalists (Serbia); Serbian Ethnic Group (Kosovo)      7\r\n5 <NA>                                                     0\r\n6 Journalists (Kosovo)                                     7\r\n  INTERACTION REGION COUNTRY ADMIN1    ADMIN2          ADMIN3\r\n        <dbl> <chr>  <chr>   <chr>     <chr>           <chr> \r\n1          37 Europe Kosovo  Mitrovica North Mitrovica <NA>  \r\n2          60 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \r\n3          37 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \r\n4          37 Europe Kosovo  Mitrovica Skenderaj       <NA>  \r\n5          60 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \r\n6          78 Europe Kosovo  Pristina  Pristina        <NA>  \r\n  LOCATION        LATITUDE LONGITUDE GEO_PRECISION SOURCE            \r\n  <chr>              <dbl>     <dbl>         <dbl> <chr>             \r\n1 North Mitrovica     42.9      20.9             1 Vecernje Novosti  \r\n2 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 Zeri; Local Source\r\n3 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 UNMIK             \r\n4 Prekaz              42.8      20.8             1 B92.net           \r\n5 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 BBC News; RTK     \r\n6 Pristina            42.7      21.2             1 Insajderi         \r\n  SOURCE_SCALE        \r\n  <chr>               \r\n1 Regional            \r\n2 Subnational-Regional\r\n3 National            \r\n4 Regional            \r\n5 National-Regional   \r\n6 National            \r\n  NOTES                                                               \r\n  <chr>                                                               \r\n1 As reported on April 20, 2018, female journalists on Serbian Pink T~\r\n2 On May 3, 2018, on the occasion of the World Press Freedom Day, in ~\r\n3 On June 12, 2018 in Pristina, Kosovo, Valon Rashiti, a reporter for~\r\n4 On September 9, 2018 in Prekaz, Kosovo, two female reporters of Deu~\r\n5 On January 28, 2019 in Pristina, Kosovo, employees of public broadc~\r\n6 On August 23, a journalist was attacked and punched by PDK leader's~\r\n  FATALITIES  TIMESTAMP\r\n       <dbl>      <dbl>\r\n1          0 1572403786\r\n2          0 1574110420\r\n3          0 1553853272\r\n4          0 1572403700\r\n5          0 1572403627\r\n6          0 1567533545\r\n\r\nHmm, can’t seem to glean much from that… we’ll come back to select specific variables in a bit. For now, let’s see how many rows and columns are in this dataset. I can do this with the “ncol()” and “nrow()” functions. Doing this, I see that there are 29 columns and 12460 rows in the journalist.data dataset. What you don’t see in the last sentence is that my row and column amounts were calculated within backstrokes (these little guys ``, not to be confused with these guys’ ’. See chapter 27.2 in the R for Data Science textbook for this trick).\r\n#Let me give you the column names from my dataset.\r\n\r\n [1] \"ISO\"              \"EVENT_ID_CNTY\"    \"EVENT_ID_NO_CNTY\"\r\n [4] \"EVENT_DATE\"       \"YEAR\"             \"TIME_PRECISION\"  \r\n [7] \"EVENT_TYPE\"       \"SUB_EVENT_TYPE\"   \"ACTOR1\"          \r\n[10] \"ASSOC_ACTOR_1\"    \"INTER1\"           \"ACTOR2\"          \r\n[13] \"ASSOC_ACTOR_2\"    \"INTER2\"           \"INTERACTION\"     \r\n[16] \"REGION\"           \"COUNTRY\"          \"ADMIN1\"          \r\n[19] \"ADMIN2\"           \"ADMIN3\"           \"LOCATION\"        \r\n[22] \"LATITUDE\"         \"LONGITUDE\"        \"GEO_PRECISION\"   \r\n[25] \"SOURCE\"           \"SOURCE_SCALE\"     \"NOTES\"           \r\n[28] \"FATALITIES\"       \"TIMESTAMP\"       \r\n\r\n#As far as my untrained eye can see, there is no need for the gather() or spread() function in the dataset. Each variable has its own column, each observation its own row, and each value has its own cell. Great job ACLED, very professional!\r\n#Take a look at the following columns of data:\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 12,460 x 2\r\n   EVENT_DATE          TIME_PRECISION\r\n   <dttm>                       <dbl>\r\n 1 2018-04-20 00:00:00              2\r\n 2 2018-05-03 00:00:00              1\r\n 3 2018-06-12 00:00:00              1\r\n 4 2018-09-09 00:00:00              1\r\n 5 2019-01-28 00:00:00              1\r\n 6 2019-08-23 00:00:00              1\r\n 7 2019-12-17 00:00:00              1\r\n 8 2020-03-23 00:00:00              1\r\n 9 2020-04-11 00:00:00              1\r\n10 2020-12-22 00:00:00              1\r\n# ... with 12,450 more rows\r\n\r\nLooking through the codebook for the data I can see that the TIME_PRECISION column refers to the precision of the time an event occurred in the previous column EVENT_DATE. A code of “1” indicates the event happened on a specific day, a code of “2” indicates the even happened sometime during a specified week, and a code of “3” sometime during a specified month. I am going to recode these numbers to correspond to text. I’ll include the code as a reference to what I did.\r\n\r\n\r\njournalist.data <- mutate(journalist.data, certaintyOfDate= recode(TIME_PRECISION, `1`= \"dayOf\", `2`= \"weekOf\", `3`= \"monthOf\")) \r\nhead(select(journalist.data, certaintyOfDate, EVENT_DATE))\r\n\r\n\r\n# A tibble: 6 x 2\r\n  certaintyOfDate EVENT_DATE         \r\n  <chr>           <dttm>             \r\n1 weekOf          2018-04-20 00:00:00\r\n2 dayOf           2018-05-03 00:00:00\r\n3 dayOf           2018-06-12 00:00:00\r\n4 dayOf           2018-09-09 00:00:00\r\n5 dayOf           2019-01-28 00:00:00\r\n6 dayOf           2019-08-23 00:00:00\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it! You can now see I’ve recoded the TIME_PRECISION column to certaintyOfDate. I’ve also included the EVENT_DATE column so you can see what the TIME_PRECISION column is referring to.\r\n###Now for the be creative and have fun part. I’ll include the code so y’alls can see. I spent some time in the forums trying to get the barchart on the up and up.
