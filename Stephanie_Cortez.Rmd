Hello all. I am a Research Analyst in pursue of the DACSS Program Certificate to enhance my skills. I currently have a BA in Social Work and Society from Cal State University, Northridge. I also live in Northridge, CA with my hubs and 7 kiddos. Yes, 7 kiddos. #BlendedFam :) <3

Learning R so far has been a challenge but with lots of hands-on practice it'll get easier. Fingers crossed. 

Ok. Good luck. Bye.
