## I first read in the .csv file into myData
```{r, include=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
myData <- read.delim("../../_data/congressional_hearings.csv", sep = ",", header=T)
```
## I then read the first few lines of myData through head()
```{r}
head(myData)
```
## I used nrow to find how many rows there were
```{r}
nrow(myData)
```
##100254

## And ncol to find how many columns
```{r}
ncol(myData)
```
##36

## I found the column names and listed them
```{r}
colnames(myData)
```
##[1] "id"               "source"
##[3] "CISYear"          "Unpublished"
##[5] "Chamber"          "filter_House"
##[7] "filter_Senate"    "filter_Joint"
##[9] "CISCommittee"     "Sequence"
##[11] "Month"            "Congress"
##[13] "year"             "FiscalYear"
##[15] "Days"             "Sessions"
##[17] "Committee1"       "Subcommittee1"
##[19] "Committee2"       "Subcommittee2"
##[21] "filter_Referral"  "filter_Approp"
##[23] "filter_Agency"    "filter_Program"
##[25] "filter_Admin"     "filter_Lawmaking"
##[27] "title"            "description"
##[29] "pap_majortopic"   "pap_subtopic"
##[31] "Change."          "majortopic"
##[33] "subtopic"         "ReferralBills"
##[35] "StartDate"        "AdditionalDates"

## I would use the gather() function to collect the where the bills originated into the Chamber column. I would argue that the Chambers column could be created using gather() if it was not already there. Otherwise, no. Our gather() function could look like this:

```{r}
tidymyData <- gather(myData, key = "Chamber", value = "ChamberNumber", 6:8)
```
## I made sure that the value I was working with was an integer and then calculated the median amount of sessions it took for a bill to be passed into law.
```{r}
class(myData$Sessions)
sessionMedian <- median(myData$Sessions, na.rm = TRUE)
print(sessionMedian)
```
## Using stackoverflow, I found a function that can generate a mode, or the value that occurs the most. After using that on the column chamber, I found that most of these laws began in the House.
```{r}
class(myData$Chamber)
Mode <- function(x) {
  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x,ux)))]
}
Mode(myData$Chamber)
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
