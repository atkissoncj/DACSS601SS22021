  Hello Everyone! My name is Alex and I am an undergraduate at UMass studying Political Science. I am taking this course to learn R so that I can earn my Letter of Specialization in Data Analytics! Here is some R Code:
     x <- 1:6
     y <- x*3
     z <- x+y
     z_matrix <- matrix(z, nrow = 3)
   This code creates a 3x2 matrix based off of the vector z.
