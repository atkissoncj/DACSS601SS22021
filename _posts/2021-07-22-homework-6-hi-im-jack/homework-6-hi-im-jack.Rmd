Hi, my name is John but everyone calls me Jack. This is my first time learning to code. 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

```{r}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)

graph <- filter(gapminder, country == 'Afghanistan' | country == 'Burundi')

graph2 <- select(graph, 'country', 'year', 'pop')

ggplot(data = graph2) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = year, y = pop))

```
