## The dataset I will be analyzing is called the "2021-2022 Student Equity Needs Index (SENI) Scores for Elementary Schools," which shows scores of elementary schools (grades k-5th) in the L.A. Unified School District (LAUSD) in CA. LAUSD is the largest school district in CA and the 2nd largest school district in the U.S. in terms of number of students.
## "The SENI was implemented to create a more inclusive and holistic understanding of our students' needs, and to empower schools with additional funds to address those needs at the local level."
## I'm going to try and compare some school demographics. LAUSD consits of 6 local districts, South, East, Central, West, NW, and NE. The dataset shows percent of foster youth, homeless youth, and English learners in elementary schools. I'm curious to know how local districts within the entire district compares.
