#First I load in the tidyverse
library(tidyverse)

#Then I read in the data from congressional_hearings.csv
myData <- read.delim("./Users/alexgenovese/Desktop/R Work/DACSS601/_data/congressional_hearings.csv", sep = ",", header=T)

#I found the first few data values
head(myData)

#Found how many rows there were
nrow(myData)

#And how many columns
ncol(myData)

#I identified the column names
colnames(myData)

#I tidyed the data to gather the chamber numbers into a chamber column
tidymyData <- gather(myData, key = "Chamber", value = "ChamberNumber", 6:8)

#I found the median number of sessions it took to pass a bill
class(myData$Sessions)
sessionMedian <- median(myData$Sessions, na.rm = TRUE)
print(sessionMedian)

#I then found the mode, which indicates which chamber had the most bills

  ux <- unique(x)
  ux[which.max(tabulate(match(x,ux)))]
