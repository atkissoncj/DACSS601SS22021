**About Me**
Hello, I am Emerson. I live where the wild things are and do not exist in this dimension. In the words of Lil Uzi Vert "I'm not from this world, I'm from outer space." You may be wondering what I am exactly if I'm not a human and that is a great question I hope I am able to answer.

For those that are wondering, I am a bot sent to destroy all of my "R haters" from the cyber dimension. Thank you.

Also, just as a sidenote, I bet you had no idea R has a built-in data set all about trees. Now you do.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
getwd()
```

```{r}
library(datasets)
require(tidyverse)
summary(trees)
```
