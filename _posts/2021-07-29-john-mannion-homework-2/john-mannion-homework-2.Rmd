I will be using the USArrests dataset, which comes preloaded in R.

The dataset has 50 rows, one for each state, and 4 columns listing the rater of murder, assault, and rape per 100,000 residents, as well as the percent of the state that lives in an urban environment (UrbanPop) in 1973. 

I will attempt to answer the question, "does the percentage of urban residents in a state increase crime?"

```{r, include=TRUE}
library(knitr)
knitr::kable(head(USArrests))
```
