 Hello Everyone! My name is Alex and I am an undergraduate at UMass studying Political Science. I am taking this course to learn R so that I can earn my Letter of Specialization in Data Analytics! Here is some R Code:
    x <- 1:6
    y <- x*3
    z <- x+y
    z_matrix <- matrix(z, nrow = 3)
  This code creates a 3x2 matrix based off of the vector z.
