After tidying my data in the previous assignment, I searched for correlation between initial cost and resell value.
As we can already deduce, the more expensive a car is to begin with, the more it will resell for as a result. However, I wanted to see if cars with higher initial cost hold their value more than cars with lower initial cost. 
To investigate this phenomenon, I created visualizations comprised of sale versus resale value for cars over and under 35,000 dollars.

```{r}
  expensive_cars <- filter(myDataPath, `Price_in_thousands` >= 35) #created a data set that only shows expensive cars that cost at least 35,000.
  affordable_cars <- filter(myDataPath, `Price_in_thousands` < 35) #created a data set that only shows inexpensive cars that cost less than 35,000.
ggplot(expensive_cars,
  aes(x = Price_in_thousands, y = resale__value)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  geom_line(colour = "red") +
  geom_smooth(colour = "black") +
  labs(title = "Original Market Price vs. Resale Value[Expensive Cars]") +
  theme_classic()
```


```{r}
ggplot(affordable_cars,
  aes(x = Price_in_thousands, y = resale__value)) +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  geom_line(colour = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(colour = "black") +
  labs(title = "Original Market Price vs. Resale Value[Affordable Cars]") +
  theme_classic()
```

Surprisingly, the data demonstrates cars do not retain value based on cost alone. The graphs demonstrate affordable cars have a higher tendency to hold their value than expensive cars. This is exactly the opposite of what I initially hypothesized.
