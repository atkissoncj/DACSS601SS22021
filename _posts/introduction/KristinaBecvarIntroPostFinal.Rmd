I have two cats lying on me as I write this.

One is named Lana, and she is calm and chill.

One is named Murphy, and he is a tornado.

To have both cats sleeping and keeping my legs warm is the motivation I needed to keep pushing to understand this tonight.

This mix of motivation and being goofy and tired led me to have some fun writing code that visualizes a cow quoting random Wikipedia facts:

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(cowsay)
library(wikifacts)
library(magrittr)
wiki_randomfact(
  n_facts = 1L,
  fact = c("any", "didyouknow", "onthisday", "inthenews"),
  bare_fact = FALSE,
  repeats = TRUE) %>% say(by = "cow")

```
