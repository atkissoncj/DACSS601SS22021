I chose the COVID 19 response survey dataset. I used select() to focus on a particular set of questions, then used mutate() and recode() to change the responses to a particular question to numbers, and used summarize() to find their mean value.


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```
